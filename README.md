# Electricity Automation
An app that I built for a real estate company that allows them to automate a task that took them more than 20 hours a month!
It gets the data from the PDF receipts, autofills the Excel files they use to keep track of their electricity bills, save the PDFs on their network, and provide an auto-generated description of the bill.

# What I learned
- Building and packaging software that runs on all computers.
- Dealing with inconsistent data.
- How to deal with networks.
- Reading PDF file data.
- Writing to excel files.
- Optimizing software to run faster.
- Automating tasks in the real workspace.
- Dealing with Arabic named files and directories.
- Printing Arabic variables correctly.
